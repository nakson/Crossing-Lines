## Description

- **MAIN OBJECTIVES**

  - Crosshatching is a traditional drawing technique that have been used by
    artists for centuries. It is a way to present a picture by drawing layers of
    dense lines in different angles. The main objectives are implementing the image processing from a general image to a crosshatching image, and furthermore a curve version of crosshatching.

- **EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS**

  - [Processing](https://processing.org/)

- **EXPECTED DELIVERABLES**

  - Main features to implement:
    - A base layer that detects edges from input image
    - For every other layer, lines are parallel to each other
    - Lines on different layers should find a proper angle to cross other layerâ€™s lines
    - Lines should cover dark areas and avoid light areas
    - Allow users to choose a local image file and save the output image
  - Possible additional features:
    - A better user interfaces.
    
    - Use curve instead of only straight lines to optimize the output image.

## Blog #1 Crosshatching

#### How to draw crosshatching by hand?

<p align="center">
  <img style="zoom: 50%;" src="/pic/Captdsdsd.PNG">
</p>

- Drawing five layers of closely spaced parallel lines in different angles
  - Layer 0: outline the edges. The following layers are inside of this layer.
  - Layer 1: closely spaced parallel lines in one detection
  - Layer 2: closely spaced parallel lines at 90 degree angle to layer_1
  - Layer 3: closely spaced parallel lines at 45 degree angle to layer_1
  - Layer 4: closely spaced parallel lines at 90 degree angle to layer_3

#### My plan of drawing crosshatching using Processing

- Also five layers of closely spaced parallel lines in different angles
  - The base layer detects the edges of the input image
  - For other four layers of lines:
    - lines should be inside of the edges
    - the density and length of lines should depend on the brightness of the input image





## Blog #2 Edge Detector

![hondaTypeR](/pic/hondaTypeR.jpg)

#### Algorithm

- Comparing the brightness of each pixel with it's eight neighbors
- If the difference of  brightness is too big, then this pixel is a part of edges

``` java
for each pixel p[i] of the image:
	diff = brightness(p[i]) - brightness(p[neighbor]);
	if(diff > 20):
		update p[i] to a black pixel
	else
		update p[i] to a white pixel
```

###### When the difference of brightness is > 15:

###### When the difference of brightness is > 40:

![40](/pic/40.jpg)

![meitu_1](/pic/meitu_1.jpg)





## Blog #3 Try one layer of lines

#### Things that need to figure out:

- How to make sure the lines do not appear in white space outside of edges?
- How to control the length of the lines?
  - maybe optimize the edge-layer
- How to control the density of lines according to dark and bright areas?
  - need to load both the edge-layer and original input image
